===============================================================================

In early July 2012, we set up an invite-only mixer for single retro games, kind
of like a speed-dating thing.  Most of the games invited were still getting over
some rather nasty divorce or separation issues.  It was a nice learning
experience (Dear Lord, does Custer's Revenge have baggage), but it turned out to
be something of a bust.

For the most part.

Space Invaders and Columns, as it turns out, were destined for each other.  Fast
forward to June 2013, and their first child is born.  Much rejoicing and alcohol
was had.  The baby was christened "Invasodado," meaning "Cube Invader" in Spanish.

Put together the two halves that make this whole in a seamless alien-blasting,
color-matching, high-scoring arcade puzzle-shooter experience!

CAN YOU PROTECT THE EARTH FROM A FABULOUS DOOM?

===============================================================================

In-game controls are as follows:

- Left/Right or A/D keys move your ship
- Space fires
- P pauses
- Escape returns to the menu

No experience necessary!

For menu controls:

- Up and down move through the menu
- Left and right flip through possible options, if available
- Space and Enter make a selection

This is how you play.

Your ship is at the bottom of the screen.  You can shoot one bullet at a time.
Every alien is colored; shoot one, it'll turn into a block of the same color and
fall down.  The column above your ship indicates where an enemy shot while under
that column will drop a block.  Match three or more like-colored blocks
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, and they'll disappear.

UFOs will appear occasionally, but not for long!  Shoot one and it'll drop a
special rainbow block!  If it lands on another block, it'll remove all of that
color.  If it lands on the bottom of the grid, the bottom row is cleared.
