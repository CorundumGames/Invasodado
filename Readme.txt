===============================================================================

In-game controls are as follows:

- Left/Right or A/D keys move your ship
- Space fires
- P pauses
- Escape returns to the menu

No experience necessary!

For menu controls:

- Up and down move through the menu
- Left and right flip through possible options, if available
- Space and Enter make a selection

This is how you play.

Your ship is at the bottom of the screen.  You can shoot one bullet at a time.
Every alien is colored; shoot one, it'll turn into a block of the same color and
fall down.  The column above your ship indicates where an enemy shot while under
that column will drop a block.  Match three or more like-colored blocks
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, and they'll disappear.

UFOs will appear occasionally, but not for long!  Shoot one and it'll drop a
special rainbow block!  If it lands on another block, it'll remove all of that
color.  If it lands on the bottom of the grid, the bottom row is cleared.
